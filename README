chess or something

Chess Rules:

This is assuming white is on bottom and black is on top

Pawn: definition of forward differs based on color. white’s ‘forwards’ is up, black’s ‘forwards’ is down.
if pawn is in starting position, it can move forwards one or two spaces. If not in starting position,
it can only move forwards one space. If moving forward, it can’t capture other pieces.
Pawn can also move diagonal forward one space, but only to capture other pieces.

Rook: moves as many spaces as it wants to in any cardinal direction (up/down/left/right). Cannot move through other pieces.

Bishop: moves as many spaces as it wants to in any ordinal direction (diagonals). Cannot move through other pieces.

Queen: has movement of both rook and bishop

King: moves one space in any direction

Knight: moves in two forward, one left or right. Can move through other pieces.

There’s also rules about putting your opponent’s king into check. If you can move a piece to capture your opponent’s king,
the opponent must move their piece to take their king out of check, either by moving their king, moving another piece in
the way, or removing the piece that can capture their king.

The game ends by putting your opponent’s king into checkmate. This is when your opponent has no way to take their king out of check.
